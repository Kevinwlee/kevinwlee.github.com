Hello :) I created this site to inpsire you to do more, consume less, and live a life of adventure. Take a look around and remember: Be creative, serve others, have fun, and make great things!

If you're interested in what I do for my day job, you can find all that stuff under the **[Work](/work/)** link.  If your interested in the things that I'm passionate about outside of work, then checkout my **[Blog](/)**.  I'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet/email me if you want to chat.


### Me
I run.  I read. I code. I spend my mornings, evenings and weekends playing with my family.  We constantly bounce between gyms, soccer pitches, baseball diamonds, and pools.  It's fun, and busy, and I love it. 

I've found that I'm happiest when I live by a few simple rules.  If you want to know what makes me tick, here they are:

**Rules to Live By**

- Push yourself physically everyday
- Compete
- Document the highlights of your life
- Share adventures with your friends
- Tell good stories
- Run a tight ship
- Have some rough edges.
- Donâ€™t care what others think of you, stay centered and solid.
- Keep your word.
