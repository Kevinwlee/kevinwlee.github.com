I created this site so that I can share things that are important to me.  If you're interested in what I do for my day job, you can find all that stuff under the **[projects](/projects/)** link.  If your interested in the things that I'm passionate about outside of work, then checkout the content that I have under **[topics](/topics/)**.  I'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet/email me if you want to chat.


### Me
I run.  I read. I code. I spend my mornings, evenings and weekends playing with my family.  We constantly bounce between gyms, soccer pitches, baseball diamonds, and pools.  It's fun, and busy, and I love it. 

### My Task
Live a life that inspires others to do more, consume less, and live a life of adventure.

### Just Do It!
Be creative, serve others, have fun, and make great things!

### Rules to Live By
- Push yourself physically everyday
- Compete
- Document the highlights of your life
- Share adventures with your friends
- Tell good stories
- Run a tight ship
- Have some rough edges.
- Donâ€™t care what others think of you, stay centered and solid.
- Keep your word.

### My Promise to You
I will Keep my word. I will back up my promises with hard work. I will add as much value as I can. I will relentlessly pursue My Task.
