I've been keeping a journal since April of 2011.  I'm not exactly sure why I started to journal, I can only assume that it originated from a book that I was reading at the time. 

Now, 4 years later, I journal almost every day.  I pour my thoughts, feelings, dreams, experiences, insights, etc into my journal. Sometimes I just free write, sometimes I write on a topic that interests me, and sometimes I use it to work out a problem. I honestly feel that I'm much better off because of it. Journaling has given me a deep understanding of my feelings, my goals, and even my shortfalls.

Recently I was browsing through my past enteries and couldn't help but notice how much I have discovered about myself. I have undoubtedly had failures along the way, but there is some good stuff in there.

So witihout further ado, I'm going to start sharing some of the entries that I think will be helpful to you.
