I think Seth Godin is my favorite author.  I share a lot of his views on what he often calls industrial systems, and I find his message to be motivating, clear, and actionable.  I recently listened to an [interview with him](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/02/10/seth-godin/) by [Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) and thought I'd share some of my favorite Seth Godin links.

**Books**

I found Seth by downloading Lynchpin on Audible.  To be honest, I've never read one of Seth's books, but I've listened to the following more than once, and I listen to Lynchpin at least once a year.  

- [Lynchpin](http://amzn.to/1PzqVMz)
- [Icarus Deception](http://amzn.to/214xPP2)
- [Tribes](http://amzn.to/1PzqXUB)
- [The Dip](http://amzn.to/21mnPRc)
- [Purple Cow](http://amzn.to/214xH1U)

**Videos**

Seth is a great speaker. If you want an introduction to his ideas, checkout out the Lizard brain talk or his TED talks.

Finally, his blog is where you can get small doses of Seth.

Hope you enjoy him as much as I do.
