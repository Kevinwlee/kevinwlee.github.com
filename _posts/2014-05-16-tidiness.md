Being tidy is not a default behavior anymore.  I believe that distractions (maybe laziness, but I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt here) are the root cause of many of the messes in the home and office.  Messy environments can cause as much stress as an overflowing inbox.

Tidiness, on the other hand, will enhance your productivity.  Removing distractions is the number one way to improve your focus.  Try it now; set a five minute timer and clean off your desktop. 

Doesn’t it feel good?  Do you feel like you accomplished something?  If you’re like most, you are feeling pretty happy right now and are ready to accomplish the next thing on you todo list. 

If you want to keep going and clean the rest of your rooms, here are some simple tips to get you started:

- Keep flat surfaces clear of papers and clutter.
- Keep floors clear of shipping boxes, clothes, and trash.
- Keep all sinks empty.

**PRO TIP**: Before you go to bed each night, use this list to ensure that each room is tidy.

…and if you want to go totally crazy, go clean out that drawer.  You know the one I’m talking about.  It’s full of the stuff that doesn’t have a home.  Yep, I know about it, now clean it out! :)
