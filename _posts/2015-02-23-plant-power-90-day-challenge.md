I love a good challenge.  Today I have embarked on a 90 day nutrition challenge.  I’m going to eat nothing but plant based whole foods for the next 90 days.  That’s no meat, no dairy, no processed foods, no alcohol.  I’ve even decided to drop coffee for the first few weeks.

Why am I doing this?  It’s a long story, but it really catalyzed  when I read Rich Rolls book “Finding Ultra: Rejecting middle age, becoming one of the worlds fittest men, and discovering myself.”  It’s one of those stories that hit me at the right time and place.  I had recently started training for my first half ironman triathlon and the next thing I know I’m reading Rich’s book on a flight home from Boulder.  It grabbed me.

At the core of the Rich’s transformation was his discovery of a plant based diet.  A whole foods, vegan diet.  Vegan is not a word that I ever thought I’d associate with myself.  But as I began reading stories of other endurance athletes that had also switched off of meat and dairy and saw immediate and lasting benefits, I couldn’t deny it.  It had piqued my interest.

So today, I’m taking it for a spin.  Wish me luck.


### Status
I weighed in this morning at 188.2, I felt a little groggy, and really wanted some coffee.  As I write this now, my head is a little foggy, I feel pretty mellow, and would like to take a nap.
