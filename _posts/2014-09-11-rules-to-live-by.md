The other day I was thinking about some of the aspects of my life that really fire me up and get me motivated to live with passion.  I started writing them down, and eventually made this list :) 

- Push yourself physically everyday
- Compete
- Document the highlights of your life
- Share adventures with your friends
- Tell good stories
- Run a tight ship
- Have some rough edges
- Don't care too much about what others think about you
- Keep your word

Creating your own list is simple. Think of the people in your life that you admire and list the things that you admire about them...and voila!
