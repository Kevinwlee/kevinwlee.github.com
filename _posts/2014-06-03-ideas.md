Ideas, ideas, and more ideas.  Ideas seem to come to me all the time. They come in my sleep, when I drive, when I work, and even come from my friends. For years I thought I was cool because I had ideas; I thought I was special.  I loved capturing my ideas, organizing them, and talking about them.  I tinkered, talked, and daydreamed all the time.

Recently something happened.  I looked around, I looked at all of my half baked prototypes, apps, and websites and it dawned on me.  Ideas are only a small fraction of what it takes to make great things.  Whatâ€™s really impressive are the ideas that make it off the todo list.  They go past the idea and turn into something that adds value and serves others.
