I’ve noticed that people are surprised when they see that I always carry pen and paper.  I’ve had a [Field Notes colors subscription](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/) for a couple of years and I rarely go anywhere with out a memo book in my back pocket. 

Ideas, tasks, thoughts, and other random things come up all the time.  Having a single place to capture all the “things” that come up as you work through your day can be a huge leap in productivity.  The goal is to minimize the number of inboxes in your life so that you can quickly process and prioritize the “things” in your life.

Keeping a low-tech memo book handy at all times accomplishes that goal for me.
