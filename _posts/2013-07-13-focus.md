I guess b/c I talk about productivity and time tracking all the time, I get a lot of questions about how to be productive.  What's funny is that I struggle with productivity just as much as anyone.  That said, I do obsess over it a little and I've learned quite a few techniques for maximizing productivity.  

The number one tip I can give anyone is __Focus__. That's it.  

Focus on one thing and one thing only.  remove all distractions.  Turn off things that beep, buzz, pop up, flash, etc.  

By eliminating things that demand your attention, you're able to pour your mind into the task at hand.  Don't waste cycles trying to ignore things.  Turn them off.  Then focus on one thing.

Once you are focused you can truly **g**et **t**hings **d**one.

__Pro Tip:__

Look into the [pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) if you want to learn a fantastic way to focus in short bursts.  It's my goto method when I need to GTD :D
