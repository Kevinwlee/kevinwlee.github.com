If you want to feel younger, live longer, get slimmer, sleep better, recover faster, reduce stress, resist infections, reverse chronic disease, prevent chronic disease, be more productive, and do it all with increased energy and vitality, then **it's time to change what you put on your plate.**

I switched to a plant-based diet in February of 2015.  It was a little experiment, and after 20 days, I never looked back. Swapping meat and dairy for fruits and veggies has literally changed my life, and it will do the same for you.

### General Advice

My advice is simple, and you probably already know it:  eat your fruits and veggies. Start by adding more veggies to each of your meals. Don't worry about cutting out anything at first, just focus on filling the majority of your plate with veggies.  Eat them first, and then carry on as usual.  You can eat them raw, cooked, baked, grilled, however you like.  Don't worry about carbs or fat or anything.  Just start working in the good stuff.

If you're looking for recipes, I highly recommend http://www.thugkitchen.com/  We have both of their books and have cooked almost everything in them.

**My day generally looks like this:**

- Green Smoothie for breakfast (kale, collards, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, almonds, chlorella, spirulina, banana, frozen blueberries and strawberries, Vega vanilla protein powder and filtered water).  Throw it in a Vitamix or Blendtec blender and mmm mmm good.
- Apple or Nuts or both for a snack
- Big green salad for lunch.  I load it with veggies, nuts, and seeds.  Sometimes I top it with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and sometimes I top it with salsa.
- I usually have a tomato and avocado sandwich at some point in the day. Slice a tomato, slice an avocado, sprinkle with salt and pepper, make a sandwich and boom! I recommend using Ezekiel bread which is found in the freezer section instead of the junk bread that people normally buy.  It's made from sprouted grains, which your body loves.
- Our dinners usually consist of veggies (baked, stir fried, grilled, stewed, etc) with a side of rice or quinoa.

Other simple meals: take any veggies you like, we use zucchini, yellow squash, onion, green beans, okra, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, all fresh and/or frozen.  We slice them as needed so that they can fit on a fork and throw them in a baking dish.  We lightly cover the veggies in olive oil or coconut oil, then spice them up with salt, cumin, chili pepper, and whatever else you like.  Throw that in the oven on 375 for 20 - 40 minutes, depending on how soft you like your veggies, and boom you're done.  We'll eat it on rice, in taco shells, on salads, in lettuce wraps, or with pesto.

You can basically do the same thing and stir fry it, I'd add some soy sauce to the stir fry, and then make a side of fried rice.

My wife Natalie found this awesome Curry: http://minimalistbaker.com/30-minute-coconut-curry/  she adds green beans and broccoli.  And I literally want to bathe in it!

We also love Spaghetti Squash with marinara and saut√©ed veggies.  Slice the squash in half, remove the seeds with a spoon.  Place face down on a cookie sheet and bak on 375 for about an hour.  The outside of the squash will start to turn brown when it's close to being done.  Then fork out the meat and it'll look like noodles.

Hope that helps,

Kevin

### Meatless Monday
Before I changed my diet I remember thinking that it would be impossible to live without meat or dairy.  I heard someone talking about **Meatless Mondays**, and I thought that would be a good way to try it out.  Here's a simple meatless Monday plan:

- **Breakfast**: Oatmeal + berries
- **mid-morning snack** apple and raw almonds
- **Lunch**: big green salad
- **mid-afternoon snack** cucumbers and salsa
- **Dinner**: spaghetti squash + marinara + dinner salad
- **Dessert**: banana and nut butter

### Two Week Plant Based Meal Plan eBook

My wife and switched to a plant based diet in early 2015.  The hardest part of the switch was finding tasty meals that we could work into our busy family routine.  After a few months of being plant-based, we settled in on our typical meals.  Our friends are always asking us what we eat, so we have decided to put it down in a little e-book so that everyone can get it. This meal plan comes directly from our kitchen, I hope that it will serve as a guide to help you switch to a plant based diet.
