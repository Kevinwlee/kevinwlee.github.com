I ran my first marathon on Sunday and it was another plant powered success.  I've been completely plant based for 340 days now, and have completely accepted that this is the way my body was made to eat.  I don't want to bore you with a race recap, but I do want to point out that I completed it in 3:22:58, which was better than my stretch goal of 3:30:00.  I was very proud of my effort.

What makes me so happy is that while others around me were sucking down gels, dealing with heart burn, and hunger, I was happily running without any gut discomfort, muscle cramping, or pain.  Sure my body got tired towards the end, but my last mile was faster than my first.  So what did I eat?  Here's the 36 hours of food.

water
Subway sandwhich
huge green smoothie
2 cups of coffee
water
cliff bar
banana
6 dates
electrolite drink
water
2 banana's
tomato avocado sammy
Huge green smoothie
popcorn

rice and veggies

And that's it.  Next time I'll make my own bar, but I've been happy with Cliff Bars over the years, they are plant based, and made with good ingredients, all of which I could find in my local store.
