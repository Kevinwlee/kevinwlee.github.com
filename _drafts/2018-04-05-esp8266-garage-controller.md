Okay, so I can't ever just leave stuff alone.  I had to spice up my garage controller a little.  As I mentioned before, I've used the ThingDev boards to monitor temperature and humidity throughout my house.  So I figured, my garage door controller should have a DHT22 sensor.  In addition, I'd like to know if my door was open or closed.

Turns out this is pretty simple to do.

first, let's figure out when the door is open.
