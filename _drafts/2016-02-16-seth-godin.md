I think Seth Godin is my favorite author and thinker.  I share a lot of his views on what he often calls industrial systems, and I find his message motivating, clear, and actionable.  I recently listened to an [interview with him](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/02/10/seth-godin/) by [Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) and thought I'd share some of my favorite Seth Godin links.

**Videos**

Seth is a great speaker. If you want an introduction to his ideas, checkout out the Lizard brain talk or his TED talks.

**Books**

I found Seth by downloading Lynchpin on Audible.  To be honest, I've never read one of Seth's books, but I've listened to the following more than once, and I listen to Lynchpin at least once a year.  

- [Lynchpin](http://amzn.to/1PzqVMz)
- [Tribes](http://amzn.to/1PzqXUB)
- [Icarus Deception](http://amzn.to/214xPP2)
- [Purple Cow](http://amzn.to/214xH1U)
- [The Dip]()

**On The Web**

Finally, his blog is where you can get small doses of Seth and current line of thinking.
