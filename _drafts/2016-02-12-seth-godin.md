I think Seth Godin is my favorite author and thinker.  I share a lot of his views on what he often calls industrial systems, and I find his message motivating, clear, and actionable.  I recently listened to an [interview with him](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/02/10/seth-godin/) by [Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) and thought I'd share some of my favorite Seth Godin links.

Seth Godin reads all of his books, and I think his books are designed to be read over and over.
