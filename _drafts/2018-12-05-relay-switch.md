As I tinkered with Arduino circuits, I started to get the itch to control more of the things in my home.  There are tons of off-the-shelf home automation devices, but if you are actually reading this, I'm pretty sure that's not what you're interested in.  So the question that you'll quickly have is "How do I interact with 120 volt A/C devices when the Arduino can only switch 5 volt DC?"  Enter the relay switch!

A relay is a switch.  It's very similar to a light switch, except that instead of you physically turning the switch on/off, you can use electricity (and a little magnet) to move the switch.  There are many many many different types of relays, but I like this one [LINK TO AMAZON]().
