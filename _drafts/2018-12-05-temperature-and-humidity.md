I'm slightly obsessed with weather.  It's by far the thing I as my google home mini about.  When it comes to my exploration in home automation, I tend to add temperature and humidity sensors to all my projects.  My goto sensor is the [DHT-22](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167) (also known as the RHT03).  It's easy to hook up on a bread board, and there's a library that makes using it very simple.
