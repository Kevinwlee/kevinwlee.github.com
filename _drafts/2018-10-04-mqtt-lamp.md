I've been tinkering with IoT again and I have found a pretty cool solution to what I was trying to accomplish.  MQTT.  MQTT is a pub/sub server that is designed for small devices.  It's perfect for my PiZero W, and esp8266 stuff.

Let me show you how it works.

Hardware
- thing dev board
- switch
- old lamp
- various jumper cables

Software
- Arduino IDE
- VSCode

I'll use Node.js and Arduino to write the code.
