Digital Problems

I’m sure I’ve written about it before, but I’m starting to realize that my family, and I presume, the rest of the modern world are living a very digital existence.  Most of our time is spent staring at screens, watching shows, playing games, reading social media, watching youtube.  We don’t spend much time unplugged.

The issue is that we are not digital.  We are alive.  We breath, and think, and enjoy being in close proximity to other people.  

But now, I notice that even when we are with others, the screens are between us.  They are captivating.  They draw us in, and it’s hard not to be captivated.  The content is interesting.  The shows are exciting.  The posts are intriguing.  So much so, that we can sit in the room with each other, and not have to talk.  We just sit there.  Lost in our minds as we stare at the screens.

This is a problem.  I believe that we are spiritual beings, but I don’t spend time connecting with the Spirit in others.  There is true joy when I do.  Just like there is true joy when I connect with nature.  Nature is spiritual too.  Life is right here in front of me, but I’m completely distracted.

It’s like the Matrix.  I think I may be unplugged now.  I’m starting to notice things in me and in others.  I’m starting pay attention to what is happening right in front of me.  This is causing me to feel a little out of control.  

For years I’ve been medicating myself with booze, technology, business, mindless day dreaming.  I’ve been simply distracted from reality.  The digital world has added another dimension to everyday detractions, virtual reality. 

So as a kid, I think I was tuned in.  I enjoyed what was around me.  I explored.  I slowly widened my world by exploring the neighborhoods and bayous on my bike.  I expanded.  I pushed my body.  I spent time laughing and playing with friends.  I pursued girls.  I was invested in my church.  Really there.  I spent time with people in my youth group.  

Then as I got a little older the phone became an option.  But the excitement of talking on a phone paled in comparison to real life interactions.  I could actually kiss a girl if I was with her.  I could race my friends if I was with them.  We could connect both physically, and emotionally.

I think that’s it.  Physically, we are disconnected.  We are physical beings.  We are also spiritual, emotional, mental beings.  But without the body, we are not beings. It takes all of the parts to be human.  I believe that the spiritual part of us lives on into eternity.  And from what I understand, so does the physical part.  It may be broken down and recycled by nature, but the bits live on. 

That’s what’s missing.  We are not present, and technology is making that more and more the norm.

When I think about what it’s doing, it makes me a little sad and frustrated.  We are filling our minds with ideas, thoughts, creativity, and junk.  We get images that others found joy in creating, but those same images distract us from what’s in front of us.

I enjoy my alone time.  I enjoy being able to look inward in my soul, searching for the meaning of my life.  I love to learn about the parts of me that make me me.  And I love to learn about the parts of me, that relate to others.  And even more so now, I love learning about the “observer” in me.  The one that see’s my fingers typing this as the thoughts come out of the void of my mind.  The one that takes the feelings and uses the mind to express thoughts and feelings in this journal.  But I’m starting to see that it’s the daily interactions, and the mundane tasks where you can find real life.  There are big moments in life too, times of achievement, times of defeat, times of great gain and great loss.  Those times are great alone, but I believe they are better when experienced with others.

Be present. Touch. Smell. Hear. Feel.

Socialize in person.  Pay attention to the living and breathing person.  Talk to people. Then if they aren’t near, call them.  But work on getting in front of them.  Then if that’s not there, use technology to reach out to the people that matter to your life.  But always find a way to meet them in person.  It’s the in person connections that make life full.  

And when you finally are with someone, be present.  Don’t let yourself get distracted.  Ruthlessly get rid of distractions.  Remove “rush” and “hurry” from your life.  Those are constructs that are bound to time, and time is a manifestation of our human Ego.  Time is not real.  It’s a tool to help record and order our day, but nothing is as important as the present moment.  

Jesus sets a great example of how to be present.  He always took time to connect with the people around Him.  He noticed the meek and the bold. So should I. So should you.
