I’m sort of obsessed with accounting and personal finance.  By no means am I a financial genius, but I love the mechanics of accounting.  There’s something soothing to my soul about reconciling a bank account, tracking where we spend our money, watching our money grow, etc.  I’m sort of a geek about it (as you can probably tell).

I need a budget.  I can’t tell you how many times my wife and I have asked each other, “where did it all go?” at the end of the year.  Some years I’m really good at budgeting, and my account balances grow, other years, I ‘m lazy, and we tend to stay flat.  What I’ve learned after 18 years of paying attention to my finances, is that if I don’t tell my money where I want it to be spent, it seems to disappear.

So if you are wondering where all your hard earned money is going at the end of each month, it’s time to start paying attention to where your money is going.  It’s time to start telling your money where to go.  It’s time for a budget.

There are all sorts of systems out there, [Dave Ramsey](http://www.daveramsey.com/home/) is a fantastic resource when it comes to getting control of your financial situation.  His [FPU](http://www.daveramsey.com/fpu/home/), [Baby Steps](http://www.daveramsey.com/baby-steps/), and radio show are fantastic if you are struggling with money. He has an online budgeting tool too.  You can use [mint.com](http://mint.com) to track and budget your money.  If you use a large bank, you probably have access to some online budgeting tools. You can use a spreadsheet, or even pen and paper.

A co-worker pointed me to [youneedabudget.com](http://youneedabudget.com) the other day, so I decided to give it a try.  I totally love it, and have decided to give it a run for a year.  Getting it up and running for the first time was a little hard, but after I got it all set up, I quickly fell in love with it.  It accounts for money exactly how I like to account for it, and it has many little features that makes my accounting brain do the snoopy dance.  I also love their content (https://www.youneedabudget.com/learn)

The tool doesn’t matter when it comes to a budget. What matters is that you find something that works for you.
