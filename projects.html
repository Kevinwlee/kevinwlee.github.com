			<p>Late in 2009 I started to dabble in iOS development.  Maybe it was the lure of the AppStore, or the tedium of building back office web applications, I'm not sure, but iOS quickly changed from an interest into a passion.</p>
			<p>After working as a Lead iOS developer at ChaiONE Inc for a couple years, I decided it was time to go out on my own.  Well, it turns out it's really lonely on the road, so I reassessed, and decided to go back to ChaiONE.  That's where you'll fine me today, and I coulnd't be happier.</p>
  		<p>I got my start building ASP pages back in 1999.  That progressed into 8-9 years of ASP.net consulting work.  When MVC was released I fell in love with the framework and started reading up on its roots.  That led me to Ruby on Rails, which is where focused for a few years.</p>
  		<p>I started to dig into client-side web development in 2008, and quickly jumped on the jQuery bandwagon.  That blossomed into full-on javascript love.  I'm currently playing with Node.js and learning all the goodness that it has to offer.  I've also jumped head first into Ember.js.  It's where I spend most of my time these days.</p>
